Description: A client for SensorThings API (STA, 
  see <https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings>) as specified
  by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). With the package users
  can retrieve (meta)data from STA instances and interactively
  create requests, plots, and maps for near real-time observation
  data based on available sensors, observed properties, locations etc.
  using thematic, temporal, and spatial filtering. Users can also
  create requests to load data into STA instances.
